Introduction to Node.js 
  Node.js is an open-source project that lets you write Javascript that runs outside the browser.
  When you write JS for the browser, your code is given access to global objects like the document and window, as well as other API's and libraries.
  With Node, your code can access the hard drive, databases, and the network.
  
  The package.json file
    This is created using npm init, and it acts as your Node project's manifest. It holds your project's name, version number, description,
    and other information. You can create this file by hand, or you can let npm do it for you. 
    
  When starting a new project
    Make a directory, and move into it. Then run npm init in it. This will create a package.json file with pretty sensible defaults. 
    
  One of the keys in package.json is scripts. Here you can add any commands you might need to run again and again. 
  
  When you use the http module, you can create a server using 
    var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {//something}); 
    - This callback pattern should look a little familiar from browser events, but in this case, it is an event happening on the server. 
    Namely, an http request. 
    
  There is a module called nodemon that automatically stops and restarts your program whenever you save changes. If you 
  save this in the scripts portion of package.json though, you will need to say 'npm run {scriptname}'
  
  You can use the req.url property for access to the url that the request sent. 
  
  Using the path module 
    This allows it easier to manipulate the file path
