Chapter 1
  Express is philosophically similar to jQuery. It simplifies the API's Node.js and adds new features.
  Although it is fast, often faster than Ruby or Python, the biggest reason to use it is that it's all one
    programming language. 
    
  The JavaScript function that processes browser requests in your application is called a request handler.
  
  Middleware
    Middleware is poorly named, but it's a term that's not Express-specific and has been around for a while. 
    The idea is pretty simple: you make several request handler functions that each deal with a small chunk of
    the work. These smaller request handler functions are called middleware functions. 
    
    Middleware can do stuff like sending static files, to setting HTTP headers. They work in a chain of sorts. 
  
  Routing
    Routing is better named than middleware. Like middleware, it breaks the one monolithic request handler function
    into smaller pieces. Unlike middleware, these request handlers are executed conditionally, depending on what 
    URL and HTTP method a client sends.
    
    The behavior of these routes is, like middleware, defined in request handler functions. 
    
  Subapplications
    Express applications can often be pretty small, even fitting in just one file. As your applications get larger,
    though, you'll want to break them up into multiple folders and files. In express lingo, these miniapplications
    are called routers.
