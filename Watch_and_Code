Version 1:
    -Arrays have various methods associated. One of them is the .push method where it will add what's
    in the parentheses to the end of the array. This function adds to the array and returns the length
    of the array.
Version 2:
    -Think about the sandwich recipe when talking about functions. 
    ex:
    function makeSandwichWith(filling) {
      Get one slice of bread;
      Add filling;
      Put a slice of bread on top;
    }
    The parameter is a generalized term that encompasses all of the uses of the function
Version 3:
    -What you would call datamembers of objects in c++, are called properties in JS.
    -You do not need to define the variables in an object. Just use the key-value pair notation.
    -You still access them the same way as you would in c++ using the dot notation.
    -To include functions as properties (methods), you still use the key-value pair, but the value is an
    anonymous function.
    -When you want to reference the object that you are in, JS has a keyword *this* that allows you 
    to reference the object.
Version 4:
    -Parts of a for-loop: 
        -Initialization
        -Condition
        -final-expression
    -It is good form to use array.length as part of the condition in order to make the for loop dynamic
Version 5:
    -Included if, else statements.
