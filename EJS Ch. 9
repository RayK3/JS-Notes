Regular Expressions

Some people, when confronted with a problem, think ‘I know, I’ll use regular expressions.’ Now they have two problems.

Creating a Regular Expression
  A regular expression is a type of object. It can either be constructed with the RegExp constructor
  or written as a literal value by enclosing a pattern in forward slash characters.
  ex:
    let re1 = new RegExp("abc");
    let re2 = /abc/;
    
  Both of these regular expressions represent the same patter, an a character followed by a b character
  followed by a c. 
  
Testing for Matches
  Regular expression objects have a number of methods. The simplest one is test. If you pass it a string,
  it will return a Boolean telling you whether the string contains a match of the pattern in the expression.
  
  If you put anything between square brackets, it will match if any of the characters is found. 
  ex: 
    console.log(/[0-9]/.test("in 1992"));
    // returns true
