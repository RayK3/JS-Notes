Data Objects:
    Any time you use dot notation, you can also use square brackets. The expression between the brackets is ealutated first and then
    used to try and find a property of that name.
    
    *-Array method: join(" "); This joins all of the elements of an array into a string with the argument passed between them.
    -Although uncommon, you can use the delete operator to remove a property from an object.
    -in: this operator returns a boolean value that indicates whether an object has that property.
    
    -Adding and removing things at the start of an array are called unshift and shift. (Shift takes off and returns the value, 
    and unshift adds it)
    
    -indexOf and lastIndexOf both search the array for a value and return the index. The former searches from the beginning and 
    looks forward, where the latter searches from the end and looks backward. They both have an optional second argument that 
    indicates where to start searching from.
    
    -slice, takes two arguments and cuts an array into a slice between the two indeces. The first index inclusive and the second
    index exclusive. If you only pass one argument, then it will take the remainder of the array after that argument.
    
    -The place in which global variables live is called the global object, and is stored in the window variable.
