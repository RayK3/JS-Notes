General Knowledge about the JS runtime, and Node JS:

In javascript, you can only run one thing at a time. You can kind of get around this by using built in web api's
which can also run one thing at a time. An example is ajax, or setTimeout. When these function calls start,
they are sent to the web api to finish, and are removed from the call stack. When they finish, their return
is sent to the task queue which waits for the call stack to be empty before putting its contents back into
the stack. This is a way of asynchronous programming.

-A promise is like the receipt at a burger place. You know you will get the burger at a later time, but you can
still start to think about the burger and figure out some of the things you will do with the burger, even
though you may not have it yet. 
-Promises help manage concurrency
