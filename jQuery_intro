What is jQuery?
  jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. 

  The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. 

  The jQuery library contains the following features:
    -HTML/DOM manipulation
    -CSS manipulation
    -HTML event methods
    -Effects and animations
    -AJAX
    -Utilities
    
jQuery Syntax
  The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action 
  on the element(s).
  
  Basic syntax: $(selector).action()
  
The Document Ready Event
  $(document).ready(function() {
    //jQuery methods go here...
  });
  
  or...
  
  $(function() {
    //jQuery methods go here...
  });
  
  This is to prevent any jQuery from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).
  
  It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it.
  This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head
  section. 
  
jQuery Selectors
  jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).
  
  jQuery selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types,
  attributes, values of attributes and much more. 
  
  The #id Selector
    The jQuery #id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML tag to find the specific element. 
    
    An id should be unique within a page, so you should use the #id selector when you want to find a single, 
    unique element.
    ex:
      $("#test")
      
  The .class Selector
    This is to find all elements within a specific class. To find elements with a specific class, write 
    a period character, followed by the name of the class:
    ex:
      $(".test")
      
  Special Selectors
    To select all elements, use $("*")
    
    To select the current HTML element, use $(this)
    
    To select elements with a specific attribute, use $("[attribute]")
    
    To select all even or odd elements of some type, do :even or :odd 
    ex: 
      $("tr:odd") to select all odd table rows.
      
      
jQuery Event Methods
  jQuery is tailor-made to respond to events in an HTML page. 
  
  What are Events?
  All the different visitor's actions that a web page can respond to.
  
  ex: Keyboard Events           Form Events           Document/Window Events
      keypress                  submit                load
      keydown                   change                resize
      keyup                     focus                 scroll
                                blur                  unload
                                
  Some common Event Methods:
  $(document).ready()
  click()
  dblclick()
  mouseenter()
  mouseleave()
  mousedown()
  mouseup()
  hover()
  focus()
  blur()
  
  The on() Method
  This is the closest equivalent to the addEventListener method in plain JavaScript.
  You can add multiple event handlers to the same element with this:
  ex: 
    $("p").on({
        mouseenter: function() {
            $(this).css("background-color", "lightgray");
        },
        mouseleave: function() {
            $(this).css("background-color", "lightblue");
        },
        click: function() {
            $(this).css("background-color", "yellow");
        }
    });
    
jQuery Effects - Hide and Show
  Hide, Show, Toggle, Slide, Fade, and Animate. WOW!
  
  Syntax:
  $(selector).hide(speec,callback);
 
  The optional speed parameter specifies the speed of the hiding/showing, and can take the following
  values: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds. 
  
  The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the hide() or show() method completes.
  
  jQuery toggle()
    With jQuery, you can toggle between the hide() and show() methods with the toggle() method. 
    Shown elements are hidden and hidden elements are shown: 
    ex:
      $("button").click(function() {
        $("p").toggle();
      });
      
  jQuery Fading Methods
    With jQuery you can fade an element in and out of visibility.
    jQuery has the following fade methods:
      - fadeIn()
      - fadeOut()
      - fadeToggle()
      - fadeTo()
      
    Their syntax is the same as hide, show, and toggle
    
  jQuery fadeTo() Method
    The jQuery fadeTo() method allows fading to a given opacity (value between 0 and 1).
    
    Syntax:
      $(selector).fadeTo(speed, opacity, callback);
      
jQuery Effects - Sliding
  The jQuery slide methods slide elements up and down. 
  slideDown()
  slideUp()
  slideToggle()
  
  Same syntax as you are used to
 
jQuery Effects - Animation
  The jQuery animate() method lets you create custom animations. 
  
  Syntax:
    $(selector).animate({params}, speed, callback);
    
  The required params parameter defines the CSS properties to be animated. 
  Any css parameters that use a dash must be camelCased for jQuery. 
  ex: 
    font-size is fontSize
  
  *By default, all HTML elements have a static position, and cannot be moved. To manipulate
  the position, remember to first set the CSS position property of the element to relative, fixed,
  or absolute!
  
  It is also possible to define relative values (the value is then relative to the element's current
  value). This is done by putting += or -= in front of the value: 
  
  You can even specify a property's animation value as "show", "hide", or "toggle"
  ex: 
    $("button").click(function() {
      $("div").animate({
          height: 'toggle'
      });
    });
    
  When you declare a bunch of animations consecutively, they enter their own queue, and are 
  executed one-by-one. 
  
jQuery Stop Animations
  The jQuery stop() method is used to stop animations or effects before they are finished. 
  Syntax:
    $(selector).stop(stopAll, goToEnd);
    
    The optional stopAll parameter specifies whether also the animation queue should be cleared
    or not. Default is false, which means that only the active animation will be stopped, allowing
    any queued animations to be performed afterwards.
    
    The optional goToEnd parameter specifies whether or not to complete the current animation
    immediately. Default is false.
  
jQuery Method Chaining
  With jQuery, you can chain together actions/methods. 
  Chaining allows us to run multiple jQuery methods (on the same element) within a single statement.
  This is very similar to what you know from d3.
  
  This actually means that browser does not have to find the same element more than once. 
  
  Ex:
    $("#p1").css("color", "red").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);
    Which is usually written more like this:
    $("#p1").css("color", "red")
            .slideUp(2000)
            .slideDown(2000);
   
jQuery DOM Manipulation
  jQuery comes with a bunch of DOM related methods that make it easy to access and manipulate
  elements and attributes.
   
  Get Content - text(), html(), and val()
  text() - sets or returns the text content of selected elements
  html() - sets or returns the contents of selected elements (including HTML markup)
  val() - Sets or returns the value of form fields 
   
  Get Attributes - attr()
  The jQuery attr() method is used to get attribute values.
  The following example demonstrates how to get the value of the href attribute in a link:
  ex:
    $("button").click(function() {
      console.log($("#w3s").attr("href"));
    });
    
jQuery - Add Elements
  - append() - Inserts content at the end of the selected elements
  - prepend() - Inserts content at the beginning of the selected elements
  - after() - Inserts content after the selected elements
  - before() - Inserts content before the selected elements
  
  You can send several arguments into any of these methods and they will add all of them. 
  
  ex:
    function afterText() {
      var txt1 = "<b>I </b>";
      var txt2 = $("<i></i>").text("love ");
      var txt3 = document.createElement("b");
      txt3.innerHTML = "jQuery!";
      $("img").after(txt1, txt2, txt3);
    }
    
jQuery - Remove Elements
  To remove elements and content, there are mainly two jQuery methods:
  - remove() - Removes the selected element (and its child elements)
  - empty() - Removes the child elements from the selected element
  
  ex: 
    $("#div1").empty();
    $("#div1").remove();
    $("p").remove(".test", ".demo");
    
jQuery - Get and Set CSS Classes
  - addClass() - Adds one or more classes to the selected elements
  - removeClass() - Removes one or more classes from the selected elements
  - toggleClass() - Toggles between adding/removing classes from the selected elements
  - css() - Sets or returns the style attribute
  
  When adding multiple classes, they are separated with a space. Like this: 
    $("#div1").addClass("important blue");
    
  To return a CSS Property:
    css("propertyname");
  To set a CSS Property:
    css("propertyname", "value");
  To set multiple CSS Properties:
    css("propertyname":"value","propertyname":"value",...});
    
jQuery - Dimensions
  jQuery has several important methods for working with dimensions:
  - width()
  - height()
  - innerWidth()
  - innerHeight() 
  - outerWidth()
  - outerHeight()
    
  jQuery width() and height() Methods
    - The width() method sets or returns the width of an element (excludes padding, border and margin).
    - The height() method sets or returns the height of an element (excludes padding, border and margin).
    
  jQuery innerWidth() and innerHeight() Methods
    - The innerWidth() method returns the width of an element (includes padding).
    - The innerHeight() method returns the height of an element (includes padding).
    
  jQuery outerWidth() and outerHeight() Methods
    - The outerWidth() method returns the width of an element (includes padding and border).
    - The outerHeight() method returns the height of an element (includes padding and border).
    
jQeury - Traversing
  What is Traversing?
    Traversing is moving through HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. 
  There are a few types of traversal, though the most common is tree-traversal. 
  
  jQuery Traversing - Ancestors 
    An ancestor is a parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, and so on. 
    
    Traversing Up the DOM tREE
      - parent()
      - parents()
      - parentsUntil()
      
      jQuery parent() Method:
        The parent() method returns the direct parent element of the selected element. 
        
      jQuery parents() Method:
        - The parents() method returns all ancestor elements of the selected element, all the way
        up to the document's root element (<html>).
        - There is an optional parameter to filter the search for ancestors. It finds all the 
        parents that match the type of element you are looking for. 
        
      jQuery parentsUntil() Method:
        - The parentsUntil() method returns all ancestor elements between two given arguments. 
        ex:
          $("span").parentsUntil("div");
  
  jQuery Traversing - Descendants
    A descendant is a child, grandchild, great-grandchild, and so on. 
    
    Traversing Down the DOM Tree
      - children()
      - find()
      
      jQuery children() Method:
        The children() method returns all direct children of the selected element.
        This method only traverses a single level down the DOM tree.
        This also can take an optional parameter to filter the search. 
        
      jQuery find() Method:
        The find() method returns descendant elements of the selected element, all the way down
        to the last descendant. 
        ex:
          $("div").find("span");
          
  jQuery Traversing - Siblings
    Siblings share the same parent. 
    
    Traversing Sideways in the DOM Tree
      - siblings()
      - next()
      - nextAll()
      - nextUntil()
      - prev()
      - prevAll()
      - prevUntil()
      
      jQuery siblings() Method:
        The siblings() method returns all sibling elements of the selected element.
      
      jQuery next() Method:
        The next() method returns the next sibling element of the selected element.
        
      jQuery nextAll() Method:
        The nextAll() method returns all next sibling elements of the selected element.
        
      jQuery nextUntil() Method:
        The nextUntil() method returns all next sibling elements between two given arguments. 
      
      jQuery prev(), prevAll() & prevUntil() Methods:
        These work the same as next() nextAll() and nextUntil() except they work in the opposite 
        direction.
