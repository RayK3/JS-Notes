Program Structure:
    Expressions and Statements: 
    -An expression is a fragment of code that produces a value. 
    -If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, then a statement corresponds to a full sentence.
        A program is simply a list of statements. These are what end in semicolons.
        
    Variables:
    -To catch and hold a value, programs need variables
    -After a variable has been defined, its name can be used as an expression
    -a single var statement may define multiple variables. The definitions must be separated by commas
        ex: var one = 1, two = 2;
    
    Functions:
    -Executing a function is called invoking, calling, or applying it. You can call a function by putting 
    parentheses after an expression that produces a function value.
    -Anything that a function actually does besides producing values is called a side effect. 
    
    Prompt and Confirm:
    -the confirm function shows a dialog box with an ok and cancel button. The user must click a button and the 
    result is stored as a boolean value. 
    -the prompt function takes two arguments. The text that is shown in the dialog box, and the initial text to be 
    shown in a text box. This function returns a string of what the user wrote.
    
    isNaN is a function that returns true if the argument given is not a number.
    
    Loops:
    -You can use break to immediately jump out of a loop, which you know how to do
    -You can also use continue, which skips the loop to its next iteration.
