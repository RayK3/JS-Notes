What's making Node more popular than Rails and other alternatives?
    It's basically JavaScript plus a bunch of C/C++ under the hood for things like interacting with the
    filesystem, starting up HTTP or TCP servers and so on.
    
    Since it uses callbacks, it can handle concurrent operations without multiple threads of execution, so
    it can scale pretty well.
