-A network protocol describes a style of communication over a network. Protocols are built on top of other protocols.
-Most communication on the Internet is built on top of one protocol: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
    TCP: one computer listening, with a port associated, and another computer that establishes a connection using the port number
    After connecting, the listening computer is the server, and the connecting computer is the client
    
-The Web: a set of protocols and formats that allows us to visit web pages in a browser
    To add to the web, a machine connected to the internet needs to listen on port 80 using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Each web document has a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), that indicates the protocol, the server, and finally the resourse
    
-A computers IP address could be used as the server in a URL, but it is easier to register a domain name to point 
towards a machine or set of machines

-Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the document format used for web pages
    Contains text, as well as tags that give structure to the text (links, paragraphs, and headings)
    Tags are starting with an opening tag like <p> (for a paragraph) and closed with </p>
    
-Including angle brackets in the text of a document, use &lt; ("less than") and &gt; ("greater than")
    Something enclosed between an ampersand and a semi-colon is called an entity, and will be replaced by the character it represents4

-<script> is an HTML tag that allows us to include a piece of JavaScript in a document
    Either the actual code can be inserted between the <script> and </script>, but it is often more applicable to
    give the tag a src (source) attribut in order to retrieve a text file from a URL 
    
-Sandboxing: the idea that a program is severely limited by a a browser in what it can do. It is as if it is \
    harmlessly playing in a sandbox
