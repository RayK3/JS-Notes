Opening a web page: the browser retrieves the page's HTML text and parses it. Parsing is basically 
    taking in an HTML document and pulling out the relevent information from it.
    The browser builds a model of the documents structure after parsing, and uses the model to draw the page on teh screen
    
Document Structure: an HTML document is basically a nested set of tags, which are usually represented by boxes
    For each box, there is an object, which we can interact with to find out things such as what HTML tag
    it represents as well as which boxes and text it contains. 
    This is called the Document Object Model, or DOM
    
In HTML, comments are written between <!-- and -->

HTML documents can be looked at as a tree, with many nodes pointing to their parent and children
    All element nodes have a getElementsByTagName method, which collects all elements with the given tag name that are descendants of the 
    given node and returns them as an array-like object.
    
You can also give element nodes an id attribute, and use document.getElementById to find that node.
