Research: 
  -getElementById() seems like a specific version of querySelector().
  -getElementById() is only a method of the document object. Unlike querySelector() and querySelectorAll() which are methods
  of all element objects. This is because there is no need for a local version of the function due to the fact that each id must be 
  unique.
