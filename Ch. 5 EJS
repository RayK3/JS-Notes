Higher-Order Functions:
Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

    Abstractions hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level.
    
    -The forEach loop has two parameters, the first is an array, and the second is a function that will be done on each index
    of that array.
    -*But it is better to use it as a method call where you only need to pass it the function.
    
JSON 
    -JavaScript gives us functions, JSON.stringify and JSON.parse that convert data to and from this format.
    
Filter: is a method for arrays that takes an array and a function. It stores a new array with only the values that pass the test
in the function

Reduce: is a method for arrays that takes three arguments. An array, a function that will combine them and what to start them as.
If you just leave off the start parameter, the function will start with the first index of the array.
If used as a method, it takes just one parameter, which is the function used to reduce.
