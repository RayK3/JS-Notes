Using ES6 with Babel
  Tools for Compiling JavaScript
    Babel is a compiler. Its job is to translate ES6 syntax into the equivalent ES5 code to be 
  run by a browser's JavaScript engine.
  
  Class syntax:
    So a class is new in JS, but it still doesn't work the exact same way as c++.
    It basically just makes for shorter syntax to do what you already knew how to do. 
    
    ex:
      class ChatApp {
        constructor() {
          this.hello = function() {
            console.log('hello');
          };
        };
      }
      
      new ChatApp();
