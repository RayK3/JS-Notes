Real-Time Communication with WebSockets
  With regular GET and POST requests, your browser has to make a new request and wait for a response for each exchange of data with the server. 
  As you learned, Ajax requests do not cause page reloads, they do generate just as much network traffic, with each request and response requiring a little
  bit of overhead to produce and process. 
    WebSockets, on the other hand, provides a twp-way communication protocol over HTTP. It creates a single connection and keeps it open
    for real-time communication.
    
  The WebSockets module
    Basically serves as another way to create a server. 
    ex:
      var WebSocket = require('ws');
      var WebSocketServer = WebSocket.Server;
      var port = 3001;
      var ws = new WebSocketServer({
        port: port
      });
      
      console.log('websockets server started');
      
      ws.on('connection', function (socket) {
        console.log('client connection established');
      });
      
      When this connection is established, it will be available using the socket argument. 
      
  You can use another module called wscat. This allows you to connect to your WebSocket. You do this with the command:
    wscat -c ws://localhost:3001 (or whatever url you are trying to reach).
    
  The ws object keeps track of all connections via its clients property.
